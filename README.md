# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Video Course Notes

This repository is my personal learning space for mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in JavaScript, inspired by the course by [HuXn WebDev](https://www.youtube.com/@huxnwebdev).  
📹 [Watch the course here](https://youtu.be/wBtPGnVnA9g)  

> 💡 While the course provides the structure, everything here is built by me:
- I write my own **notes and explanations** of core DSA concepts.
- I build **custom implementations** from scratch.
- I solve **additional problems** to reinforce and apply my learning.
